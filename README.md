## **Description**
- A hypercasual, music based (addictive :P) game. 
- You can change the music and doing just that changes the difficulty of the game :D
- If you listen closely you'll discover that the pickups come every beat :) 
- You can choose any of the included music under assets/music/{producer's name} or choose any music you have on your local device.
- Note that if you are using music stored on your device it's recommended to keep that file in a folder named after the producer of that track.

<br>

## **Objective**
- Collect pickups in the way and score as much as you can ðŸŽµ
- Have fun ðŸ˜‰

<br>

## **Boom!**
