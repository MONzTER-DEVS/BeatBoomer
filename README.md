## **Description**

### Description: A hypercasual, music based (addictive :P) game. You can change the music and doing just that changes the difficulty of the game :D. If you listen closely you'll discover that the pickups come every beat. :). You can choose any of the included music under assets/music/{producer's name} or choose any music you have on your local device.<br>

<br>

## **Objective**

- Collect pickups in the way 🎵
- Have fun 😉
