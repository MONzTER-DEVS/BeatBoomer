## **Description**
A hypercasual, music based (addictive :P) game. You can change the music and doing just that changes the difficulty of the game :D. If you listen closely you'll discover that the pickups come every beat. :). You can choose any of the included music under assets/music/{producer's name} or choose any music you have on your local device.<br>

<br>

## **Objective**
- Collect pickups in the way and score as much as you can ðŸŽµ
- Have fun ðŸ˜‰

## **NOTE**
This (awesome :P) project is still under active development, so if you have any suggestions, want to get latest updates before everyone else, or want to just have a talk with us, join our (discord)[https://discord.gg/JWsuCXSwnp]!
